## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Graph Database: NetworkX ✅
- **Why:** Python-native, easy to integrate, good for prototyping
- **Persistence:** Pickle/GraphML for save/load
- **Migration Path:** Can move to Neo4j later if needed

### Entity Extraction: Hybrid Approach ✅
- **spaCy NER:** Baseline entity detection
- **Custom Rules:** Financial domain patterns
- **LLM Validation:** Use Ollama for ambiguous cases

### V-Feature Strategy: Clustering ✅
- **Method:** K-Means on V1-V339 features
- **Output:** 8-10 behavioral clusters with names
- **Integration:** Add to documents and graph properties
