# Financial Intelligence Platform - Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & RAG Proof-of-Concept (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: To rapidly validate the core RAG concept and establish the foundational development environment.

### Epic: Environment & CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with branching strategy
- [ ] Set up a local development environment (e.g., using venv or Conda)
- [ ] Implement basic pre-commit hooks for automated testing and linting

### Epic: Data Ingestion Prototype
- [ ] Ingest IEEE-CIS transaction data (CSV) and SEBI orders and reports
- [ ] Write simple Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation

### Epic: Baseline RAG Pipeline (Model 1)
- [ ] Implement a prototype RAG pipeline using Langchain
- [ ] Utilize ChromaDB for in-memory vector storage
- [ ] Integrate all-MiniLM-L12-v2 for embedding generation

### Epic: Demo Interface
- [ ] Develop a minimal FastAPI endpoint for querying
- [ ] Build a simple Streamlit front-end for internal demos

**Deliverable**: A functional prototype proving that natural language queries can retrieve relevant information from the pilot datasets, all running on a local machine.

---

## Phase 2: Production-Grade RAG Engine & Data Pipeline (Weeks 5-10)
**Goal**: To re-architect the prototype into a scalable, high-performance core engine with the full suite of production models.

### Epic: Data Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Develop robust Python functions to simulate real-time data ingestion
- [ ] Integrate data processing directly within the Langchain application flow

### Epic: Core Engine Hardening (Models 2, 3, 4)
- [ ] Utilize a persistent local ChromaDB instance for vector storage
- [ ] Fine-tune the Fin-E5 embedding model (Model 4) on domain-specific financial text and integrate it
- [ ] Set up and integrate a local LLM using Ollama (Model 2)
- [ ] Implement the post-retrieval re-ranking step using the bge-reranker-large cross-encoder as Model 3

### Epic: Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] Develop a suite of test queries
- [ ] Run benchmarks comparing the retrieval accuracy of the baseline all-MiniLM model vs. the fine-tuned Fin-E5 model

**Deliverable**: A fully operational, locally runnable Core Intelligence Engine, benchmarked for performance and ready to be connected to a user interface.

---

## Phase 3: The Analyst's Cockpit (UI & API Development) (Weeks 11-15)
**Goal**: To build the feature-rich, interactive web application for financial fraud analysts.

### Epic: Secure API Gateway
- [ ] Finalize all required endpoints in FastAPI
- [ ] Implement basic API key authentication for local use

### Epic: UI/UX & Front-End Development
- [ ] Develop the Streamlit or React front-end based on finalized high-fidelity designs
- [ ] Build the core "Generative Narrative" component, ensuring citations are clickable and trace back to source data
- [ ] Integrate data visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib) for KPI dashboards

### Epic: Case Management & Reporting Features
- [ ] Implement a simple workflow for case creation and annotation (e.g., storing status in a local JSON or SQLite file)
- [ ] Develop the automated SAR pre-population feature, which calls the core engine to generate a draft report

**Deliverable**: A fully functional, local web application for analysts, ready for demonstration.

---

## Phase 4: Evolution to GraphRAG & Network Intelligence (Weeks 16-21)
**Goal**: To implement the platform's key differentiator: relationship-aware intelligence using a knowledge graph.

### Epic: Graph Database Integration
- [ ] Set up and configure Neo4j Desktop. Alternatively, use the NetworkX library for in-memory graph analysis
- [ ] Design and implement the graph schema (nodes: Customer, Account, Device; edges: Owns, Used, Transferred_To)

### Epic: Graph ETL Pipeline
- [ ] Enhance the data processing functions to include an Entity and Relationship Extraction step (using NLP)
- [ ] Write logic to populate the local graph database in real-time

### Epic: GraphRAG Core Engine Upgrade
- [ ] Update the RAG retrieval logic to perform multi-hop graph traversals for context gathering before querying the vector DB

### Epic: Interactive Graph Visualization
- [ ] Develop a new component in the UI that allows analysts to visually explore entity connections (e.g., using Pyvis for NetworkX or built-in Neo4j visualization)

**Deliverable**: A locally runnable GraphRAG system capable of answering complex, multi-hop queries and visualizing financial networks.

---

## Phase 5: Production Deployment & Handoff (Weeks 22-25)
**Goal**: To deploy the complete Analyst Platform to a free hosting service and finalize documentation.

### Epic: Application Deployment
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment by creating a requirements.txt file
- [ ] Write deployment scripts and configurations for Streamlit Community Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces
- [ ] Ensure the application can be launched successfully in a cloud environment

### Epic: Final Testing
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing on the deployed application
- [ ] Perform a final security check for common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks)

### Epic: Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Finalize all technical documentation
- [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and how to run/deploy the application

**Deliverable**: A fully deployed, publicly accessible web application, a complete code repository, and final project documentation.

---

## Phase 6: Public-Facing Consumer Security Suite (Weeks 26-31)
**Goal**: To adapt the core technology into a suite of easy-to-use security tools for the general public.

### Epic: Public API & Web Application
- [ ] Develop a new, simple, mobile-first web application for the consumer features, deployed on the same free platform

### Epic: Feature 1 - Secure Document Analysis
- [ ] Build a secure file upload pipeline that sends a document to the Core Engine for analysis
- [ ] The engine will use the fine-tuned Fin-E5 model (Model 4) for semantic understanding and the generative LLM (Model 2) to produce a simple, jargon-free risk report

### Epic: Feature 2 - Real-Time Scam Message Analyzer
- [ ] Create a text input form that sends suspicious messages (email, SMS) to the Core Engine
- [ ] The engine will primarily use the generative LLM (Model 2) to analyze the text for scam tactics and provide an instant risk score and explanation

### Epic: User Education & Launch
- [ ] Create a user guide, FAQ, and educational content on how to act on the tool's advice
- [ ] Launch the public-facing application

**Deliverable**: A live, public web application empowering users to analyze documents and messages for potential fraud.
