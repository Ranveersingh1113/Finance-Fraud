## üéØ Phase 4 Overview (From Implementation Roadmap)

**Goal:** To implement the platform's key differentiator: relationship-aware intelligence using a knowledge graph.

**Timeline:** Weeks 16-21 (estimated 4-6 weeks for implementation)

**Deliverable:** A locally runnable GraphRAG system capable of answering complex, multi-hop queries and visualizing financial networks.

## üìã Phase 4 Epics Breakdown

### Epic 1: Graph Database Integration

**From Roadmap:**
- [ ] Set up and configure Neo4j Desktop OR use NetworkX library
- [ ] Design graph schema (nodes: Customer, Account, Device; edges: Owns, Used, Transferred_To)

**Financial Fraud Context Schema:**
```
Nodes:
- Entity (Companies, Individuals)
- Case (Investigation cases from our system)
- Document (SEBI orders, reports)
- Transaction (Financial transactions)
- Violation (Types of fraud/violations)
- Regulator (SEBI, RBI, etc.)

Edges/Relationships:
- COMMITTED (Entity ‚Üí Violation)
- INVOLVED_IN (Entity ‚Üí Case)
- CITED_IN (Entity ‚Üí Document)
- TRANSACTED_WITH (Entity ‚Üí Entity)
- PENALIZED_BY (Entity ‚Üí Regulator)
- SIMILAR_TO (Violation ‚Üí Violation)
- REFERENCES (Document ‚Üí Document)
```

**Decision Point:**
- **Neo4j Desktop:** Full-featured graph database, better for production
- **NetworkX:** Python library, easier for prototyping, in-memory

**Recommendation:** Start with NetworkX for rapid prototyping, migrate to Neo4j if needed.

---

### Epic 2: Graph ETL Pipeline

**From Roadmap:**
- [ ] Enhance data processing to include Entity and Relationship Extraction (NLP)
- [ ] Write logic to populate graph database in real-time

**Tasks:**
1. **Entity Extraction from SEBI Documents**
   - Extract company names, person names, regulators
   - Extract violation types, penalty amounts
   - Extract dates, locations, case numbers

2. **Relationship Extraction**
   - Parse "X committed insider trading" ‚Üí (X)-[COMMITTED]->(insider_trading)
   - Parse "SEBI penalized Y" ‚Üí (Y)-[PENALIZED_BY]->(SEBI)
   - Parse "Similar to case Z" ‚Üí (current_case)-[SIMILAR_TO]->(Z)

3. **Graph Population**
   - Create nodes for each entity
   - Create edges for each relationship
   - Update graph as new documents are processed

**NLP Tools Needed:**
- spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Custom rules for financial domain entities
- Relationship extraction patterns

---

### Epic 3: GraphRAG Core Engine Upgrade

**From Roadmap:**
- [ ] Update RAG retrieval logic to perform multi-hop graph traversals before querying vector DB

**Current RAG Flow:**
```
User Query ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí Top-K Documents ‚Üí Rerank ‚Üí Generate Answer
```

**Enhanced GraphRAG Flow:**
```
User Query 
    ‚Üì
Extract Entities (NER)
    ‚Üì
Graph Traversal (find related entities, cases, violations)
    ‚Üì
Expanded Context (entities + relationships)
    ‚Üì
Vector Search (enhanced query with graph context)
    ‚Üì
Top-K Documents + Graph Context
    ‚Üì
Rerank
    ‚Üì
Generate Answer (with graph insights)
```

**Example:**
- Query: "What violations has ABC Corp been involved in?"
- Graph finds: ABC Corp ‚Üí [COMMITTED] ‚Üí Insider Trading
- Graph finds: ABC Corp ‚Üí [SIMILAR_TO] ‚Üí XYZ Corp
- Graph finds: XYZ Corp ‚Üí [PENALIZED_BY] ‚Üí SEBI (‚Çπ50L)
- RAG then searches with enriched context
- Answer includes: "ABC Corp committed insider trading, similar pattern to XYZ Corp which was penalized ‚Çπ50L by SEBI"

---

### Epic 4: Interactive Graph Visualization

**From Roadmap:**
- [ ] Develop UI component for visualizing entity connections
- [ ] Use Pyvis for NetworkX or built-in Neo4j visualization

**Visualization Features:**
1. **Entity Network View**
   - Nodes colored by type (Entity, Violation, Document)
   - Edges labeled with relationship type
   - Interactive: click to explore

2. **Case Network View**
   - Show all entities involved in a specific case
   - Show relationships between entities
   - Highlight fraud patterns

3. **Violation Pattern View**
   - Show common patterns across cases
   - Cluster similar violations
   - Identify repeat offenders

**Tools:**
- Pyvis for NetworkX (generates HTML visualizations)
- Streamlit component integration
- Interactive filters (node type, relationship type, time range)

## üîç Example Use Cases for GraphRAG

### Use Case 1: Multi-Hop Entity Investigation
**Query:** "Show me all violations related to ABC Corp and similar companies"

**GraphRAG Process:**
1. Extract entity: "ABC Corp"
2. Graph query: Find ABC Corp ‚Üí violations
3. Graph query: Find ABC Corp ‚Üí similar entities
4. Graph query: Find similar entities ‚Üí violations
5. Vector search: Get documents for all violations
6. Generate comprehensive answer with network context

**Expected Answer:**
"ABC Corp was involved in insider trading (Case #2023-042). The company has connections to XYZ Industries, which was also penalized for market manipulation (Case #2022-018). Both cases share similar patterns of executive trading before announcements. SEBI imposed penalties of ‚Çπ35L and ‚Çπ50L respectively."

---

### Use Case 2: Pattern Recognition
**Query:** "What are common patterns in insider trading cases?"

**GraphRAG Process:**
1. Graph query: Find all insider_trading nodes
2. Graph query: Find entities connected to insider_trading
3. Analyze relationship patterns (executive roles, timing, amounts)
4. Vector search: Get detailed case descriptions
5. Generate pattern analysis

---

### Use Case 3: Network Visualization
**Analyst Action:** Click "View Entity Network" for Case #2023-042

**Result:** Interactive graph showing:
- Central node: ABC Corp
- Connected nodes: 3 executives, 2 related companies
- Violation nodes: Insider trading, market manipulation
