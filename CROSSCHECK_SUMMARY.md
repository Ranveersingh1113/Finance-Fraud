## 🎯 Phase 4: What's Next According to Roadmap

### Required Epics (From Implementation Roadmap)

#### Epic 1: Graph Database Integration
**Roadmap Says:**
- [ ] Set up Neo4j Desktop OR NetworkX
- [ ] Design graph schema (Customer, Account, Device nodes; Owns, Used, Transferred_To edges)

**Our Context:** Financial fraud domain requires different schema:
- Nodes: Entity, Case, Document, Violation, Regulator
- Edges: COMMITTED, INVOLVED_IN, CITED_IN, PENALIZED_BY, etc.

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED - Ready to begin

---

#### Epic 2: Graph ETL Pipeline
**Roadmap Says:**
- [ ] Entity & Relationship Extraction using NLP
- [ ] Real-time graph population logic

**Our Approach:**
- Extract entities from 205 SEBI documents
- Use spaCy + custom rules for financial domain
- Populate graph as documents are processed

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED - Planned in [PHASE4_PLANNING.md](PHASE4_PLANNING.md)

---

#### Epic 3: GraphRAG Core Engine Upgrade
**Roadmap Says:**
- [ ] Multi-hop graph traversals for context gathering
- [ ] Update RAG retrieval logic

**Our Enhancement:**
```
Current: Query → Vector Search → Generate
GraphRAG: Query → Graph Traverse → Enriched Context → Vector Search → Generate
```

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED - Architecture designed

---

#### Epic 4: Interactive Graph Visualization
**Roadmap Says:**
- [ ] Pyvis for NetworkX OR Neo4j built-in visualization
- [ ] UI component for exploring connections

**Our Features:**
- Entity network view
- Case network view
- Violation pattern visualization
- Interactive Streamlit integration

**Status:** ⚠️ NOT STARTED - Specified in planning
